The condition is readiness.

The two methods for selecting the test value is boundry analysis, and equivalence partitioning.

For boundry analysis, we can test some edge values. For example for this example, we can test 0 (no ingredients available), 0.1 (few ingredients available), 1 (all ingredients available) and 0.9 (almost all ingredients available)

For equivalence partitioning, we can select a few ranges to test, like no,low, medium,high,full readiness. Could look something like:
None: 0
Low: 0.01 - 0.3
Medium: 0.31 - 0.6
High: 0.61 - 0.99
Full: 1

For this example equivalence partitioning is the better option, since it allows to test some values, representing how the user most likley use the system. It gives us 5 values to test instead for example 100 (0.00 -> 1.00)
