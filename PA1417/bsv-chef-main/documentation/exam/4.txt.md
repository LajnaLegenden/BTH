In unitesting, mocking is when we replace depencencies with fake version of themselfs. This makes it easier to test code seperatly from each other. Since unit testing should focus on one part of the code, this can replce other components to isolate testing. It also helps with seperating edgecases more efficently.

In this code, we would mock the calculate_readiness(receipe, available_items) function call. This allows us to test edge cases, so we can test the functionality of the function. We might want to see how the code behaves with a 0, 1 or 0.234262 test score.
