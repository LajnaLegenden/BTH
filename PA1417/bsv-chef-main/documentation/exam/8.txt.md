Test case independence menas that one test should not depend on another test. Tests should be able to run independently, and in any order. 

In the tests before, if we first test changing an amount to 0, and next test is to change it to 4. But if the first fails, it might already be 4. This would be a false positive.

If we violate this, issues can be harder to find, and tests might become inconsistent.

You can avoid theese issues by isolating tests, and data, so no test rely on a test being completed.
